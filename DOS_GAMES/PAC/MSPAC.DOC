1. System Requirements
----------------------

386-33 with local bus video ( minimum )

It is at its best running on a 486-33, or better, with local bus
video ( VESA or PCI ).

1 Meg of extended Memory ( if you want sound )
Sound Blaster Pro, or compatible, soundcard.
Multi-sync monitor for the full screen mode.
                                            
Note: This game won't run on a 286.

Note: You will need 1Meg of extended memory so make sure you have
      HIMEM.SYS or someother XMS manager loaded in you config.sys.



2. Running the Game
-------------------

At the DOS prompt type

mspac
    then hit enter

or if you want to run the full screen mode and your monitor can
take it ( READ SECTION 5 !!)  type

mspac F 
   then hit enter



 
3. Game Instructions
--------------------

Eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, eat a flashing power pill then chase and 
eat the ghosts. Also eat any bouncing fruit for extra points. That's about 
all there is too it really. 

Eating a '.' is worth 10 points, power pills 50 points. 
Ghosts score 200,400,800,1600 eaten in order.

Extra lives at 10000pts, 30000pts, 50000pts, 80000 pts
then every 30000 after that.

Fruit are worth various points, fruit appears in sequence until all the fruit 
has appeared. Then a random fruit may bounce out into the maze.



4. Controls & Keys
------------------

Arrow keys, or
'A' - Up 
'Z' - Down 
'N' - Left 
'M' - Right

'P' - Pause
'Q' - Sound On/Off


On the title screens, press 

'A' for info about the game,

'J' to calibrate and use a joystick

'C' to turn sound on/off, set full screen mode and to turn of
    the FAST option. There was an upgrade for MsPacMan that made
    her move about twice as fast as the ghosts, this gives the
    same results. See section 7 for details.

ESC - Quits current game or exits program


5. Soundcard Support
--------------------

This game only supports Soundblaster Pro or better soundcards. It should work
with compatibles but I haven't tested it with many.

To allow sound in the game you need to set the DOS 'blaster' variable. 
If you  have a soundblaster Pro, or better, this should be done already 
in your autoexec.bat. 
If you don't set the blaster variable but have a SB-Pro  compatible card, 
eg. Zeos integrated business audio using the ESS chip ( is that an obscure 
soundcard or what?) you need to do the following at the DOS command prompt

set blaster=A220 I5 D1 

Where :
A is the port your card uses, usually port 220.
I is the interrupt the card uses, usually 5 but it could be 7.
D is the DMA channel to use, usually 1 could be 3.

There are immediate plans to support any other soundcards or the PC's 
internal buzzer. However I like the look of these new Interwave based
cards so I might get one of those and support it in the future.



6. Video Mode Support
---------------------

This is really important !! 

MsPacPC supports a full screen mode, this uses a vertical resolution of 288 
pixels and horizontal resolution of 224 pixels, just like the old arcade 
machine ! This mode only really works on 'newer' multi-sync monitors 
( eg. CTX 1765/1545 ). 

By default MsPacPC runs in a compatible mode, 320x200 pixels and the screen 
scrolls up and down. To run in its full glory run with the command line 
option F  ie.  MSPAC F

If your screen blanks or the picture goes crazy it probably means that your 
monitor can't run the full screen mode, so just hit escape and run with the 
compatible mode.

Also you can configure the video mode from the 'Config' screen within MsPacPc. 
Just hit 'C' on one of the title screens.



7. New 'Config' Screen Options
------------------------------

From the main title pressing 'C' takes you to the 'Config' screen
here you can make MsPac move double her speed, turn audio on/off and
Change the video mode.

Two new features have been added also

Number of Lives:
'N' will change number of lives you can play with from 1 to 5.

Begin Level:
'B' changes the beginning level from 1 to 30. The game plays
pretty much the same after level 21 with mazes 3 & 4 repeating
with different colours. So you don't need to go higher than 29.
Carry on pressing 'B' as after level 30 is goes back to 1.

Joystick Sensitivity:
'T' changes how sensitive the program is to joystick movements. Values range
from 3 to 14. Default is 5. 

What this controls is how much you need to move the joystick in a particular 
direction for the movement to be registers. Setting this value to the 
maximum, 14, would mean to move up you would need to push the joystick all 
the way to the top. Lower values would mean you didn't have to push so far
up for the movement to be detected.


 
8. About the Game & Author
--------------------------

Welcome to release 1.02 of MsPacPc, this is a more minor update to MsPacPc 
which fixes a few bugs and improves joystick support. It would have been 
released a few weeks ago but a trip to England and the flu kinda got in
the way. Oh, can't forget finishing the update for PacPc now v2.00 and
a lot better.
             
This game has been in development since June 1995, which was when I completed 
PacPc. It's been and on/off process as pressures of work, visiting England 
and going on holiday have almost all taken priority, the first release came
out in Dec 1995 and the first update in Feb 1996.

I've tried to keep the 'feel' of the game as close to the original as 
possible, playing the arcade machine next to PacPc the differences aren't to 
hard to stomache, and if they are buy an arcade machine. I've tried to keep 
the ghosts movements close to the original and you'll find their characters 
are much the same, Sue will sort of 'gravitate' to the area of the maze you 
are in, Blinky will just come straight at you, Pinky can take a 'round about' 
way to find you and Inky is pretty much like Blinky.

This time I put in all the fruit, and all the little intro sequences, I got a
lot of feedback from PacPc with folk saying. "Wasn't there more fruit ?"
or "Where's the second intro screen".

The game was written in 'C', with assembly routines for sound, sprite 
graphics, joystick, drawing characters on the screen that sort of thing, and 
was coded on, in turn, a Zeos pentium 90, a Zeos pentium 100 ( in fact a 90 
clocked at 100 ) a DEC 486-dx2-66 with a little work on a Zeos P120 running 
winslows 95. Please don't mail me asking for the source code, I won't
be releasing it.

The custom video mode uses a 'tweaked' mode 13h to give a resolution of 288 
by 224, all sprites are on a 16x16 matrix. Sound was improved and now uses 
16kHz 8 bit samples, all 'borrowed' from the original machine. I also wrote 
a interrupt driven keyboard driver, that should ( hopefully ) stop any 
keyboard problems that some have experienced with PacPc.

One thing is that you'll need a card with a decent video bandwidth, just 
about anything VLB/PCI will do, a regular old ISA card probably won't 
hack it.

I might do some updates, if it really needs it. But I'm not going to be
adding support for any other soundcards, sorry folks.

This game is freeware, you don't have to register/pay/contribute or whatever, 
it's free !! Now who said "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch...". 
This game is 'as is' and comes with no warranty either specific or implied, 
you are quite free to distribute it, copy it or eat it, whatever you want to 
do. You should not, however, charge for it. Selling this game for profit, 
rather than a duplication fee, will result in really bad Karma, and depending 
on your religious persuasion may result in eternal damnation, or at least
a couple of centuries in purgatory.
