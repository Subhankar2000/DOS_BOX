MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EXPRESS
=========================

Outlook Express Mail is an Internet standards based e-mail and news
reader.
 
To read e-mail with Outlook Express, you must be using an e-mail system
that uses SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols. At this time, you cannot use 
Microsoft Outlook Express to access your e-mail account with any of 
the following services:

  MS Mail
  cc:Mail
  The Microsoft Network (MSN), with the exception of the MSN "Metro"
   (MSN 2.5) beta release
  CompuServe
  America OnLine (AOL)
  Microsoft Exchange Server prior to version 5
  HOTMail

If you don't know whether your system uses these services, contact your
administrator or your Internet service provider (ISP) and ask if they
support SMTP/POP3 e-mail clients.


KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS RELEASE
============================

- When receiving a message using a GeoCities e-mail account, you might 
  be unable to view any of the original message, or you may see only 
  the following:  "Postage Paid by... [graphic]."  

- You will not be able to see embedded objects or images sent from
  people using Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange, or Windows
  Messaging. File attachments work fine, however.

- If you use HTML in your signature, and you send the message before
  any included images have finished drawing, the text you add to the
  message may be lost.

- Some e-mail clients send messages written in Cyrillic characters
  with tags indicating that they are in a western European character
  set. As a result, Outlook Express uses a western-European font to
  display the message, which then appears garbled. To work around this
  problem, click the View menu, click Language, and then choose a
  Russian character set, such as K0I8. The message should display
  properly using the Russian font.

- If you send a Rich Text (HTML) message which contains embedded
  pictures, and the option Send Pictures With Message is turned
  off, any pictures from a local computer or LAN will not be displayed
  when receiving and reading the message using Netscape Messenger.
  
  

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

- If you run into a problem, see the Troubleshooting topic in
  Outlook Express Help or go to the following Web site:
  http://support.microsoft.com/support/ie/iewin16/default.asp
  
  Also make sure of the following:

- You are properly connected to your Internet service provider.

- If you are unable to send or receive mail, check whether the
  following is true:

  - The TCP/IP protocol is installed on your computer.
  - All cables are properly connected to your computer, modem, or LAN.
  - You have a PPP or SLIP account with your ISP.
  - Your ISP or LAN server supports POP3 and SMTP.
  - Your modem communication parameters (baud rate and type of 
    protocol) are set correctly.


TIPS AND TRICKS
===============

- Use the Check Names command (on the Tools menu or New Message toolbar)
  to resolve a person's e-mail address against your address book or
  directory server when you are sending mail. The name will be underlined
  when the associated address is found.

- You can move the toolbar to the bottom edge of your screen by
  right-clicking it and then choosing Bottom from the Align menu.

- To send a mail message in Plain Text only (no HTML formatting),
  click the Format menu, and then click Plain Text. To make Plain 
  Text the default setting for new messages, replies, and forwarded 
  messages, click the Tools menu, and then click Options. Click the Send 
  tab, and then select Plain Text under Mail Sending Format. 

- You can resize the preview pane or the message list by dragging the
  divider between the preview pane and the message list.

- You can change how the preview pane splits, or turn it off entirely,
  by clicking the View menu, clicking Layout, and then changing the
  options in the dialog box.

- You can set news messages to automatically download to the preview pane
  by clicking the Tools menu and then clicking Options. Click the Read
  tab, and then selecting the check box labeled Automatically Show
  Messages In The Preview Pane.

- To view the e-mail address of someone who has sent you a message,
  double-click the message to open it, and then double-click the author's 
  name in the From field. You can also add this person to your Address
  Book by right-clicking the name and then clicking Add To Address 
  Book.

- In mail, you can leave a copy of your messages on the server. To set
  this option, click the Tools menu, and then click Accounts. Select
  the mail account you want to modify, and then click Properties. Click 
  the Advanced tab, and then select the check box labeled Leave A Copy
  Of Messages On Server.

- To add a custom signature to all messages, click the Tools menu, and
  then click Stationery. On the Mail tab, click the Signature button,
  type a signature or specify a signature file, and then select the
  check box labeled Add This Signature To All Outgoing Messages.

  To add the signature to replies and forwarded messages, you need to
  clear the option labeled Don't Add Signature To Replies And Forwards.

- It is possible to use HTML files as signatures.

- To reorder columns, you can drag and drop column headings. Columns
  can be resized by dragging the right edge of the column header.
