1. INSTALLING WINDOWS 3.1 DRIVERS FOR

   1.1 SETUP WINDOWS 3.1 DRIVERS AGAIN

   Q1. How can I setup my Windows 3.1 drivers again.

   A1. You may setup Windows 3.1 drivers again by running INSTALL 
       from your audio software directory at the DOS prompt.  Select 
       "Setup Windows" and follow the instructions on the screen to 
       complete the setup.


   1.2 USING DRIVER APPLET IN CONTROL PANEL (OEMSETUP.INF)

   Q1. My drivers are not installed when I use the driver applet 
       in Control Panel to add the drivers.  What do I do?

   A1. Before you choose to add any audio software drivers, 
       you should first remove all the existing audio drivers 
       shown in the "Installed Drivers List" and then restart 
       Windows. Chances are existing versions of audio drivers 
       are installed when you start-up Windows and cannot be 
       over-written. You must also restart Windows after adding 
       all the drivers for these new drivers to take effect.  
       Refer to your Windows User Reference Manual for more detail 
       on the Driver applet.


   1.3 GENERAL

   Q1. No matter what I try, I can't get sound in Windows.  What
       should I do to fix it?

   A1. Here are some points you can check:

   a. If you installed Windows 3.1 using the "Express Installation",
      Windows scanned your hard disk for programs to be installed. 
      As a result, older versions of the audio software applications 
      may have been installed if they were on your hard disk at the 
      time of installation.  Please remove these icons.  To do this, 
      click on the icon once to select it, then press the delete key.
      Windows will ask you for confirmation.  Repeat the above
      procedure for each icon.

   b. Open the Driver applet in Control panel.  You should at least
      have the following driver names in the Installed Drivers list:

        Creative SB16 Wave/Aux/Mixer/MidiPort Driver
        Creative Stereo Music Synthesizer Driver
        MIDI Mapper
        Timer
        [MCI] CD Audio    ;this is only for owners of CD-ROM drives
        [MCI] MIDI Sequencer
        [MCI] Sound

      If one or more of the drivers do not exist, you must install the
      driver(s) using the Driver applet in Control Panel (See your
      Windows manual for more details).

   c. Check your SYSTEM.INI by choosing RUN from the File menu of the
      Program Manager and typing NOTEPAD SYSTEM.INI in the command
      line box.  Examine the [Boot], [drivers] and [sndblst.drv] 
      sections. They should look something like this:

        [Boot]
        drivers=mmsystem.dll msmixmgr.dll

        [drivers]
        Timer=timer.drv
        Midimapper=midimap.drv
        Aux=sb16snd.drv
        MIDI=sb16fm.drv
        Wave=sb16snd.drv
        MIDI1=sb16snd.drv
        Mixer=sb16snd.drv

        [sndblst.drv]
        port=220
        int=5
        dmachannel=1
        hdmachannel=5
        MIDIport=330
      

   d. If Windows refuses to install a device driver or if you get the
      error message "Device not found" when playing a Wave or MIDI
      file, or a CD, be sure that you have the following settings in
      the [mci] section of SYSTEM.INI.

        [mci]
        WaveAudio=mciwave.drv
        Sequencer=mciseq.drv
        CDAudio=mcicda.drv; this is only for owners of CD-ROM drives

      If one or more of the drivers do not exist, you must install 
      the driver(s) using the Driver applet in Control Panel (See 
      your Windows manual for instructions).  Do not type in the 
      entries into the SYSTEM.INI because the files have to be 
      expanded and installed into your SYSTEM directory by Windows.


2. DOS DRIVERS

   2.1 BYPASS LOADING THE DOS DRIVERS

   Q1. I do not wish to load the DOS drivers CTSB16.SYS and
       CTMMSYS.SYS at system startup.  What should I do?

   A1. To bypass the loading of the DOS drivers CTSB16.SYS and
       CTMMSYS.SYS, press the ALT key during system starts up.

       Or, you can use a text editor to REM the following lines in
       your CONFIG.SYS file.  These lines load the DOS drivers at
       system startup.

       DEVICE=C:\SB16\DRV\CTSB16.SYS /UNIT=0 /BLASTER=A:220 I:5 D:1 H:5 P:330
       DEVICE=C:\SB16\DRV\CTMMSYS.SYS


3. GENERAL

   3.1 AUDIO SOURCE SETTINGS

   Q1. I can't hear anything from the speakers, but when I run the
       diagnostic program, it sounds okay.  What do I do?

   A1. Check the mixer settings for the various sources.  Use the
       programs SB16SET.EXE in DOS or CTMIXER.EXE in Windows to 
       adjust the settings to a higher level.


   3.2 ELIMINATING JERKY DIGITIZED SOUND PLAYBACK 

   Q1. The playback sounds jerky.  Is my card defective ?

   A1. If you are in Windows, this may be due to your choice 
       of Windows swap file.  Temporary swap file tends to be 
       fragmented causing jerky playback.  If possible, use a 
       permanent swap file to eliminate this problem.  Refer to 
       your Windows manual for instructions on creating a permanent 
       swap file.

       Loading a disk cache program such as SMARTDRV will also
       eliminate this problem.  To load SMARTDRV, refer to your DOS or
       Windows manual for instructions.


   3.3 ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS WHEN WINSETUP.EXE RUNS

   Q1. When I start Windows and WINSETUP runs, it gives me a dialog
       box saying it can't find the environment.

   A1. The BLASTER environment is not set or is incorrectly set.  
       This program requires that your BLASTER environment is set 
       correctly and tallies with your audio hardware.  You can 
       type "SET" at DOS prompt to check the environment settings.  
       For more details on the BLASTER environment, refer to your 
       Getting Started manual.


4. GAMEPORT

   Q1. How do I disable the GamePort?

   A1. There are a few ways for you to enable or disable the GamePort.
       This depends on the type of audio card you have.

       a. Non Plug and Play card
          To enable or disable GamePort, you need to set the appropriate
          jumper.  Please refer to your Getting Started manual for the
          location of the jumper.  If your audio card does not have the 
          GamePort enable or disable jumper, you can use GAMEPORT.EXE
          utility to enable or disable the GamePort.  You may not have
          the GAMEPORT.EXE if your audio card does not support GamePort
          software enable or disable.

       b. Plug and Play card
          For Plug and Play card, you need to use the BIOS setup or the
          ISA Configuration utility to enable or disable the GamePort.
