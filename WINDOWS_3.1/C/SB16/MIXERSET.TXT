MIXERSET UTILITY
================

The MIXERSET utility allows you to adjust the volume and other Mixer
controls (such as balance, gain and tone) of the audio output and
recording sources supported by your audio card.

You can use the utility as a command at the DOS prompt or invoke the
MIXERSET interface to control the Mixer settings through a full-screen
window consisting of check boxes and sliders.

The file provides you detailed information on using MIXERSET.  It is
organized as follows:

*	Knowing the MIXERSET Command
*	Using the MIXERSET Command
*	Starting the MIXERSET Control Screen
*	Knowing the MIXERSET Control Screen
*	Using the Mouse and Keyboard


Knowing the MIXERSET Command
----------------------------

The Mixer is configured using the switches that follow the MIXERSET
command. To use the MIXERSET command:
1.	Change to your sound directory.
2.	Type MIXERSET [switches] ...  and press <Enter>.

where switches can be one or a combination of any of the following:

	/? or /H	Displays help messages.
	/Q		Runs MIXERSET without displaying the setting 
			information.
	/P		Sets the Mixer according to the PRESET settings in
			the CTMIX.CFG file.
	/MA:n;x		Sets the MASTER volume and balance of left and right 
			channels.
	/VO:n;x		Sets the VOICE volume and balance of left and right
			channels.
	/MI:n;x		Sets the MIDI volume and balance of left and right 
			channels.
	/CD:n;x		Sets the CD volume and balance of left and right
			channels.
    /LI:n;x     Sets the LINE-in volume and balance of left and right
            channels.
    /MIC:n      Sets the MICrophone volume.
    /SP:n       Sets the PC SPEAKER volume.
    /TR:n;x     Sets the TREBLE level and balance of left and right
            channels (if available).
    /BA:n;x     Sets the BASS level and balance of left and right
            channels (if available).

    NOTE: n specifies the volume level and ranges from 0 to 255, and x
    specifies the balance of the left and right channels, and ranges
    from -5 to +5.  x must be preceded by ';'.
		
    For example, /MA:200;5 sets the master volume at 200 and the
    balance at 5 (this means that the volume will be reduced in the
    left channel). /MA:;-5 setting reduces the volume in the right
    channel.

	/OPS:ss		Sets the audio output switches (OPSW) on or off.
			ss represents one or a combination of CDz, LIz and 
			MICz, where z is + (on) or - (off).

			For example, /OPS:CD+ MIC- allows you to receive
			CD-audio output.  It does not allow any sound passed 
			through the microphone to be sent to the speakers.

	/IPL:ss		Turns Left Input switches (IPLSW) on or off.
			ss represents one or a combination of CDRz, CDLz, 
			MDLz, MDRz, LIRz, LILz, and MICz, where z is + (on)
 			or - (off).

        /IPR:ss         Turns Right Input switches (IPRSW) on or off.
                        Same as /IPL.
	
	/IPG:l,r	Sets Input Gain (IPGAIN) of left (l) and right (r) 
			channels.  Both l and r can be 1, 2 or 4.

	For example, /IPG:4 sets both left and right channels to 4, /IPG:,4
	sets the right channel to 4, and /IPG:4, sets left channel to 4.
		
	/OPG:l,r	Sets Output Gain (OPGAIN) of left (l) and right (r) 
			channels.  Both l and r ranges from 1, 2 or 4.

	/AGC:+|-	Turns Automatic Gain Control (AGC, if available) on 
			(+) or off (-).

You do not need to specify the entire string of each switch that you
use, as a shortened string entry works equally well.  However, at
least 2 characters from the beginning of the switch name must be
specified with the exception of the following switches: /P, /H, /?,
and /Q.   

For example, MIXERSET /P is the same as MIXERSET /PRESET, and MIXERSET
/MA:200;5 is the same as MIXERSET /MASTER:200;5.

If you enter multiple MI, IP or OP switches, then priority is given to
MIDI (for MI switch), IPGAIN (for IP switch), and OPGAIN (for OP
switch).

Using the MIXERSET Command
--------------------------

The following are some examples on how you can use MIXERSET:

*   To set the PC speaker volume to 200:
    1. Type MIXERSET /SP:200 and press <Enter>.

*   To set the master volume to 200 with balanced output through the
    left and right channels:
    1.  Type MIXERSET /MA:200 and press <Enter>. If balance is not
        specified, both channels will be set equally.

*   To set all the above in one command:
    1.  Type MIXERSET /SP:200 /MA:200;0 and press <Enter>.


Starting the MIXERSET Control Screen
------------------------------------

To start the MIXERSET Control Screen:

1.	Change to your sound directory.
2.	Type MIXERSET and press <Enter>.
	The MIXERSET Control Screen appears.


Knowing the MIXERSET Control Screen
-----------------------------------

The MIXERSET Control Screen consists of the following components:

*	Volume Slider
*	Balance Slider
*	Automatic Gain Control Check Box
*	Save Button
*	Input Box
*	Output Box


Volume Slider
-------------
Controls the volume levels of the input sources, and the levels of
bass and treble.

Balance Slider
--------------
The sliders control the balance of the left and right speakers for
audio sources with stereo capability.  Moving the slider to the left
decreases the volume of the right speaker but the left speaker volume
is left consistent.  The opposite applies when you move the slider to
the right.

Automatic Gain Control Check Box
--------------------------------
The Automatic Gain Control (AGC) check box (if available)
automatically adjusts input gain from the microphone to a level
suitable for recording.

Save Button
-----------
The Save button saves all changes made to the Mixer to the CTMIX.CFG
file.  The new setting will be used the next time you preset the mixer
setting with the command MIXERSET /P.

Input Box
---------
The Input Box enables you to select the audio sources you want to
control as input to the Mixer.  The audio sources available are MIDI,
Line and Microphone input, and CD-audio.  You can direct these audio
sources through the left or/and right input channels of your Mixer.

NOTE:   To get a stereo sound effect, make sure that the left channel
    signal of the audio source is directed to the Left-In channel and
    the right signal to the Right-In channel.


The Spin buttons increase or decrease the input gain.  

NOTE:   The gain increases or decreases the amplification of an audio
     source.
 

Output Box
----------
The Output Box enables you to select the audio sources you want to
control as output from the microphone, Line-ln, and CD-Audio to the
left and right speakers.  You can select one or a combination of the
above audio sources playing through the card.  


Using the Mouse and Keyboard
----------------------------

Using the MIXERSET interface, the Mixer can be configured with a mouse
or a keyboard.  

For mouse control:
*   Choose the option if it is a check box.
*   Move the slider by the click and drag method or click at the
    extreme end of the slide to increase or decrease the Volume, Tone
    and Gain.
*   To quit MIXERSET, choose the Control-menu box.

For keyboard control:
*   Press <Tab> to move from one group to another.
*   Press <Shift+Tab> to move backwards to a previous group.
*   Press the up or down arrow keys to move from one option to another
    within a group.
*   Press the left or right arrow keys to adjust
    volume or gain.
*   Press <Spacebar> or <Enter> to select or
    deselect a check box.
*   To quit MIXERSET, press <Esc>.
