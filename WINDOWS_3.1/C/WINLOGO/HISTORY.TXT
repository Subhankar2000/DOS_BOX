              HISTORY FILE FOR WINLOGO
              ------------------------


v3.0 (June 1996)
------------------
1. Bitmap viewing capability added (for the Windows version only). 
   Winlogo can now be used to view your .RLE and .BMP bitmaps. Some 
  .RLE bitmaps have a negative compression ratio. Winlogo cannot 
  view such bitmaps. If such a file is encountered, an error message 
  is presented to the user.

2. This version introduces the facility to change the Windows 95
   startup logo.

3. This version has been amended (if run from DOS) to take
   an optional SECOND parameter ("/0"). If this is used as 
   the second parameter, the DOS module will not pause for 
   a keypress if the operation to change the Windows logo 
   was successful.
    e.g.,
     WINLOGO C:\RLES\BLOOM.RLE /0

   This does not work under Win95.




v2.12 (July 1994)
------------------
1. Winlogo can now be run entirely from the DOS command prompt,
   with the name of the RLE file to be used for the new logo
   being supplied at the DOS prompt.

  eg typing   "WINLOGO C:\BTIMAPS\FIRM.RLE" from the DOS command
  prompt, or from a DOS window within Windows, will cause Winlogo
  to use FIRM.RLE to build the new WINCHG.COM.

2. A bug in the DOS module which caused the new .COM file not to be
   built has been fixed.


v2.11 (February 1994)
---------------------
This is a maintenance release for version 2.10


v2.10 (October 1993)
--------------------
1. A minor bug that sometimes caused stack faults was fixed.


v2.00 (April 1993)
------------------
1. DOS version now functionally equivalent to the
Windows version.

2. First full release of DOS version and Windows version,
which both now reside within the same executable. Run it
from DOS, you get the DOS version. Run it from Windows,
you get the Windows version.

v1.50 (Feb 1993)
----------------
New (beta) DOS version now supplied with the Windows
version, with appropriate warnings.

v1.25 (Feb. 1993)
-----------------
First public release. Windows version only.

and close friends.
