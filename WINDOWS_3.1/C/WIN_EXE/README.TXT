*** FEATURES ***

Key WinZip Features include:

- Built-in PKZIP-compatible ZIP and UNZIP, so PKZIP and PKUNZIP
  are not needed for basic archive operations

- Full Drag and Drop support for opening archives, adding files to
  archives, and extracting files from archives

- Optional support for ARJ, ARC, and LZH files though external
  programs

- Optional virus scanning support, including Windows-based virus
  scanners

*** INSTALLATION ***

Installation with the SETUP program:

If you received WinZip on a disk with the file SETUP.EXE, start
the SETUP program as follows:  insert the WinZip distribution disk
in your floppy drive.  From the Windows Program manager choose Run
from the File menu, type a:\setup, and press the enter key.

Installation without the SETUP program:

WinZip is distributed on BBS systems without a SETUP program for
faster downloads.  If you received WinZip without the file
SETUP.EXE, follow this easy one-time installation procedure:

1) Create a directory to hold the WinZip related files.  The
recommended directory name (used in the following instructions) is
"C:\WINZIP".

2) Copy all WinZip-related files to this directory.  At a minimum
you need the following files:  WINZIP.EXE, WZ.DLL, WZ.COM, WZ.PIF,
and WINZIP.HLP.

3) Double click on C:\WINZIP\WINZIP.EXE in the File Manager.

That's all there is installing WinZip.  When WinZip is activated
for the first time, a few one-time only dialog boxes are
displayed.

Remember that while WinZip is active, online help is always
available by pressing the F1 key.
