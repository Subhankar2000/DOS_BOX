  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations, your Windows is now 
  configured to connect to the Internet. You will now connect to Infinity for
  the first time. The Internet Connection wizard will take you through the
  rest of the set-up and help you finish your setup by asking you a few
  questions.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Please Note:</b></i> If you are dialing
  from outside of the 416/905 area code please choose the city that you are 
  local to. Should you select a phone number that is out of your calling area
  simply select the "Phone Book" option in the Internet Connection Wizard and
  choose the appropriate phone number. Ensure that you are not dialing an access
  number with a "1" in front of it.<br><br>
